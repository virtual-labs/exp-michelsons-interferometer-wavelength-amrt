## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>
    Using a Michelson interferometer apparatus, find the wavelength of a Krypton laser.
  </li>

  <li>
    In a Michelson interferometer experiment, Helium-Neon light is used. A thin glass film of thickness 0.5 mm is introduced into the path of one of the interfering beams. For an angle of rotation of 10 degrees, it is observed that 10 fringes get displaced. Calculate the refractive index of the glass slide. (Given: wavelength of He-Ne laser = 5.43 × 10<sup>−7</sup> m)
  </li>

  <li>
    In a Michelson interferometer experiment, when the mirror is moved through 5.893 × 10<sup>−5</sup> m, 200 fringes cross the field of view. Calculate the wavelength of the monochromatic light used.

  <li>
    Using the principle of the Michelson interferometer, determine the wavelength of an Argon laser.
